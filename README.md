# Dan Blakeman

Fast learning full stack web engineer, fresh out of 14 weeks/14 hours a day coding bootcamp in London's Silicon Roundabout.

Previously designed and grew a niche social network from 0-100,000 members in one year. Keen to continue deepening my software development skills post bootcamp in a *highly* agile environment.


## Skills

### Behaviour Driven Development

Described by friends as a 'TDD purist', i prefer each line of code to be tested and delivering immediate value, either to the user or the buisness - hopefully both!

Already comfortable with: Capybara, Shoulda, RSpec, Cucumber, Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, Protractor... But would also love to learn new testing tools.
- Test drove every single app during the 12 week Makers Academy course.
- See the tests for my final project here!

### Software Craftsmanship

Each line of code we create is a legacy! Not just within the product, but of our time on earth! I'd like to be known for creating clean, simple to read, easily extended, beautiful code - that can be used to deliver real world value.

- I spent over 200 hours at Makers Academy bootcamp, pouring as much best practice into my code as possible whilst learning. Check out my repo here:
- To keep the quality high we focussed on: TDD, RESTful practices, SOLID principles, OOD, XP principles such as pair programming, finding and using a style guide and continuous integration.


### Agile

Beurocracy kills! Humans are naturally creative and collaborative and long to contribute to the world around them. Agile and lean fix the workplaces of old which prevented humans from reaching their productive potential.

- Previous to Makers Academy i used Agile and Lean principles to project manage the growth of a popular social network from scratch.
- During Makers Academy we lived and breathed agile, having small teams, twice daily standups, code reviews, retrospectives, and using Trello to manage our backlog.


### Bonus: UX, Online Marketing, Project Management & Analytics

My passion for software that serves business and user needs immediately, comes from my previous role as project owner and marketer for the worlds most popular and largest social maritime social network.

- Using analytics, A/B testing, SEO and online advertising to grow a website from its first member, to 100,000 users in one year.
- Analysed and optimised user journeys daily. Created UX, branding and concept from scratch.
- Spoke to website members on a daily basis and changed site in agile fashion to suit their needs.
- Managed external developers daily, which was my inspiration to become a developer myself!
